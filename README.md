Some advice:
1. Read the book first, and then find some good material in the website; Finally, practice begin with easy problem, don't get stuct with it too much time. Algorithms.
2. **Most Importantly, begin with simple problems.**
3. One last advice, if you can't find a solution to a problem, search for it on the internet or call for help, **understand what is does compeletly** and move on to the other. Don't let them bypass you, because what you're trying to do is **incorporate the way of thingking to your heaad.**
